          <p><strong>Slow motion</strong> (commonly abbreviated as slo-mo or slow-mo) <br>
                     is an effect in <i>film-making whereby</i> time appears to be slowed down.<br> 
                     It was invented by the Austrian priest August Musger in the early 20th century</p>
            <p>Typically this style is achieved when each film frame<br>
               is captured at a rate much faster than it will be played back.<br>
               When replayed at normal speed, time appears to be moving more slowly.<br> 
               A term for creating slow motion film is <b>overcranking</b> which <br>
               refers to hand cranking an early camera at a faster rate<br>
               than normal (i.e. faster than 24 frames per second).</p>
